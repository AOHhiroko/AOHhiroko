- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...you!! What a temperature!! we have to do something soon. Tell me the things you
do for not to get the earth hotter.  My way this summer, !. Not tu use fire to cook. Not to use air conditioners and  open windows. 2. To use frozen pillows ( almost the samething as to keep food cool). And to cool your neck with the frozen neck ring   (the same marerial is inside,which is good to go out) The earth is crying!!! And GOD is in anger!!

Let us not foeget His word, Let us sometimes come back to his word.
