### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**AOHhiroko/AOHhiroko** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...you!! What a temperature!! we have to do something soon. Tell me the things you
do for not to get the earth hotter.  My way this summer, !. Not to use fire to cook. Not to use air conditioners and  open windows. 2. To use frozen pillows ( almost the samething as to keep food cool). And to cool your neck with the frozen neck ring   (the same marerial is inside,which is good to go out) The earth is crying!!! And GOD is in anger!!!
Now we are in time of freedom,and have go-go-go- attitude to one's favorites.

But Let us not foeget His word, Let us sometimes come back to his word.
These are the word that I seached for a long time. The word which speakes to me directly.
Some People do not believe there is GOD but I 'll tell you.

In my READme, I wrote down what I think important and would like to transend to my dear ones.
