### Hi there ðŸ‘‹A famous monk:s sermon: You do not have to ask * what is the meaning of my life?* What we have to think is
:am I living facing stedily to my own everyday thingsï¼Ÿ*ã€€Last timeã€€I wrote about practice of loving kindness.That is to grow loving  kindnesss in your heart. Today the word to grow mercy, I wish my distress and suffering would go away. I wish my relatives or friend*s troubles would go away. I wish every living things*s pain would go away. You say these prayers every
day. You will read other two helping words in another day. The other day, loving kindness, and today, mercy. continues,  
translated from japanese by me.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...you!! What a temperature!! we have to do something soon. Tell me the things you
do for not to get the earth hotter.  My way this summer, !. Not to use fire to cook. Not to use air conditioners and  open windows. 2. To use frozen pillows ( almost the samething as to keep food cool). And to cool your neck with the frozen neck ring   (the same marerial is inside,which is good to go out) The earth is crying!!! And GOD is in anger!!!
Now we are in time of freedom,and have go-go-go- attitude to one's favorites.

But Let us not foeget His word, Let us sometimes come back to his word.
These are the word that I seached for a long time. The word which speakes to me directly.
Some People do not believe there is GOD but I 'll tell you.

In my READme, I wrote down what I think important and would like to transend to my dear ones.
